# microblog-flask
A tutorial for creating a flask powered microblogging app. This is based on the AWESOME [Flask Mega-tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world).


## Cool Flask Plugins used here

1. flask-sqlalchemy - A ORM for all the major DBs.
2. flask-migrate - a migrate tool for keeping the object model and tables in the db synced. Same fucntionality as
Django's migrate.
3. flask-wtf - Makes forms super easy. You basically create FormObjects and this package manages the rest.
4. flask-login - Manages the user state.
